## Starting the project

A REST server is like a webserver, but apart from static content, it also contains access to our own JSON files and different endpoints from which we can GET and POST information.

(See Node course - Section 8)

## Download this template and start your project

Just download this whole 'backup' and remember to install all your dependencies using

```
npm install ${DEPENDENCIES}

```

Good luck!
